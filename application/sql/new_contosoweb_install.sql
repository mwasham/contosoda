Hopefully you guys enjoy the interview!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell us a little bit about yourself.\r\n\r\nI''m Danny Pasminski, just turned 18 and finished highschool. I went to a catholic high school all four years. It sucked, and so did most of the people there, with a few exceptions of close friends I made. I''m now going to a community college, with an undeclared major, and hopefully am going to transfer to a university within a year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow old were you when you first got into photography? What got you interested?\r\n\r\nI started skateboarding about 7 years ago, and have always been interested documenting our exploits and shenanigans. You know, typical early teenage bullshit. Around sophomore year, skateboarding, filming, and taking photos started to get more serious... but serious doesn''t seem like the right word. We started taking the train down to the city a lot more and meeting new people. Eventually we started going on week long skate trips to other states and stuff. Thats when I wanted to start taking photos more. Just traveling to different cities and having fun with your friends. Thats what its all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere there any key photographers or influences that really played a part in the work you do now?\r\n\r\nIve always loved looking through skateboard magazines, and skate books. Not any photographer in particular, but I get psyched on "behind the scenes" photos relating to skateboarding. Those images that you can immediately connect with cause you''ve been in that situation before.\r\n\r\nWhat kept you going for so long?\r\n\r\nUmm, I guess skateboarding and traveling. Also, just trying to be spontaneous. Doing the same thing everyday kills me. If you try to stay open to things and explore, it''s like photos oportunities present themselves to you. You just have to keep your eyes open and keep trying to look at things from multiple perspectives. That might sound cliche, but it really seems to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of selling some of your work?\r\n\r\nShit, if anyone wanted to buy a print or something, I would be so psyched. I''d probably let them name the price too, as long as it covered the cost of paper and developer. haha\r\n\r\nIn ten years, where do you see yourself? personally and photography wise. Where do you want to be?\r\n\r\nI just want to be still taking pictures. I dont expect to be making a career out of it, even though I would love to. Hopefully I am still skateboarding. They both feed my love for each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat''s your set up? Any new gear coming your way soon?\r\n\r\nAs of right now, I mostly shoot film. I have a Nikon FE, and a couple little point and shoots for 35mm. Oh, and I recently got a cannonet for free, but the meter is fried. I also just got a bronica SQ with birthday money. Dont really see any new gear in the short future. I would rather be simplistic and light weight, than have a lot of gear that sits in a studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeaking of gear, what''s your go to set up?\r\n\r\nProbably my bronica or my FE. If Im going to a party, or show, I''ll bring my one touch or some sort of point and shoot.\r\n\r\nWhat''s your preferred photography style?\r\n\r\nStreet photography, or candids. I really enjoy taking pictures of things the way they are. You know, in their natural habitat. It just seems so much more true. Taking studio portraits doesnt even seem fun at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat''s your favorite thing about taking pictures?\r\n\r\nGeez, I dont even know where to start. The documentation process is awesome. Your taking a fraction of a second of an event, and slowing it down to the point where you can just stare at it for however long you like. I love that you can take that one moment, and put your creative spin on it, and have other people see and experience what you''ve just seen. Its almost like your making the moment real. Kinda like, "pics or it never happened"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo wrap up the interview, if you could change one thing about photography as a whole, what would it be?\r\n\r\nNothing really, to be honest. I like how everything is.\r\n\r\nIf I did have to choose though it would probably the redundancy of it. Theres just so many photos that look the same. People dump hundreds and hundreds of photos into an facebook album with very minute differences. Its like, maybe none of them really matter anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-for titles and more of mojo''s pictures, head on over to his flickr page\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/people/dannypasminski/', 418, 0, '2012-08-31 07:30:00'),

(568, 'Bones, Ricta, and Spitfire (Review)', 'Bones Wheels, Ricta Wheels, and Spitfire wheels are among the most popular and controversial wheels to be used by our modern skateboarding community. At this point, I''ve tried all three brands and some different formulas.\r\n\r\nMy first set of wheels were Bones STFs. They were the V3 shape, I believe, and were/are slim and slippery on most terrains. They still haven''t worn down too much (I''m pretty sure that they began as 51 or 52 millimeters; now, they''re about 48s after months of heavy powersliding and reverts). No flatspots occurred, but they did cone out just a bit. I popped a couple of bearings in them, but not many. HOWEVER, the Bones 100s (formula, not wheel thickness), did get slight flatspots, but they slid right out after a couple minutes of rolling around. Those wore down and coned out much quicker, as they were softer. They felt like a good medium, though, so I ended up getting another pair.\r\n\r\nI''m skating Rictas right now -- the Nyjah 50mm Chrome Cores -- and they are a dream. They''re a boxy shape for locking into grinds better, slide twice as well, and wear down VERY slowly. In addition, the cores protect bearings from popping and make the wheels spin straighter and faster. There isn''t much else to say; they''re great wheels.\r\n\r\nSpitfires, unlike Bones and Rictas, are known to be very grippy. I own a pair, now, and although the wheels are F1 Streetburners that were made to slide, they do grip quite a bit, to the point where boardslides are near impossible on unwaxed park concrete. Just as well, I skated them for about two weeks until I noticed that my board kept slowing down immensely after pushing. I checked the wheels and two or three of my bearings popped but stayed inside the wheels. The experience was made worse when I couldn''t get them out -- just like when I was setting the wheels up and the bearings would refuse to go into the wheel unless forced in by screwing the nuts on.\r\n\r\nOverall, Spitfires are overplayed, in my opinion, and Bones and Ricta seem to make superior wheels for street skating. Perhaps it''s different for transition and vert, but I don''t skate those enough to know.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or comments on your favorite or least favorite wheels would be awesome to hear!', 2017, 0, '2014-03-17 13:00:00'),

Those particular Trackers are racing trucks, designed to be used in a pair just like that (RT-S on back, RT-X on front) because the front one turns a little faster/more than the back, giving you a front-wheel steering bias (more like race car, more stable, etc...) and perfect for setting up on other decks. I suggest you look at maple decks 8 -8.5" wide and stick with OG style asymmetrical (directional) decks with some concave...say 30-34" long.

Longer than that, and you''ll have issues moving around the library or in lines, etc... with it. Shorter than that and you''ll miss out on the stability and room you want on campus and especially when you skate with books in your bag... which you will.

If going fast and skating around is what is appealing that would be a good size. 8"/139 with 52mm would be a great size for skating park/street, flip tricks and grinds etc. Trying both would certainly help you figure out what you like if money isn''t a big issue.\r\n\r\nI''m a bit mixed on safety gear myself, I''ve never felt the need although a helmet would be a good idea, knee pads probably won''t do anything as you don''t hit your knees much skating, wrist guards can both help or hurt more... do you tend to sprain joints or break bones? If you break bones maybe don''t wear them...

Anayway, every brand has theirs different suppliers of maple layers from different wood industries. Some of them are good some are bad.\r\nBack on what i wanted to say. Someone here said that we shouldn''t shop by brand and that we should find something that fits our taste. Well mate, you are in one hand right in one hand wrong.\r\nEnjoi, Almost, Blind, Speed Demons are one same company, same wood suppliers, same factory produces those decks, ony thing different are shapes and board pictures. Also this works for Habitat and AWS, Mystery and Zero etc...\r\nSo there is NO MATTER either if the board is Sheckler pro model or Brian Wenning pro model, IT IS THE SAME WOOD.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE SHOULD BUY BY ARE THE SERIES!!! Older series - older wood, and we all know that wood lowers its quality in time, Newer series - fresher wood and has better quality.\r\n\r\nSo someone will buy some Plan B from an older series, and it will snap easy, and someone will buy a newest series of Blind decks and it will last a longer time. And then it becomes, Plan B''s are shit and Blind rules.\r\n\r\nSo you get what I mean, we should shop by brand, and on the other hand not.

Also don''t be affraid to ask questions to the sales dude at your skateshop, they know alot more than you think and would be glad to help you out with this subject considering how most kids buy decks just out of brand interest.\r\n\r\nIt''s completly fine to ask question in this forum about it, but just keep what I said in mind.\r\nI agree, the only way you will find a board you really like is buy trying them out on your own, and your style also, some boards are better for tech where as other boards are for straight up gnar and stuff.', 495, 753, 0, '2008-07-01 18:30:00'),

I used to post on here a while back.\r\n\r\nI''ve actually been so busy lately that it is hard to get on here and post as much as a I like. I was shocked to see how much this site has grown. It is really quite amazing.\r\n\r\nThe reason I have been so busy is because I have started my own woodshop. We are now manufacturing our decks right here in Pittsburgh using 100% USA Hardrock Maple and Non-Toxic Glues. What we do is a little different than what most people who sell "blank decks" do.\r\n\r\nWe actually take the time to make our boards and sell them direct. We do not buy factory seconds or chinese boards and label them our own. We take a lot of pride in what we do. Blank Skate is 100% Skater Owned and Operated.\r\n\r\nWe sponsor a team of 8 Skaters. We love 3rd Lair and thier Top Shop Competition. We''ve been there twice now taking home a 9th and a 5th Place out of all the shops in the country.\r\n\r\nWe do demos, product tosses, contests and charity work. We have just started our own magazine that is free to view online and will come out every two months.\r\n\r\nSome of the posts stated that "blanks" don''t give back to the skateboarding. And you may be shocked to find out that I actually believe that. I don''t belive in dumping mass quantities of imported skateboards into the market or dumping them on popular auction sites. That does not contribute anything to skateboarding. It only serves to line the pockets of those who do it.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly why we do things differently. We are a Manufacturer/Shop/Deck Company all in one. We give back way more than we take.

(3079, 'Globe Mojo Hi: It''s aight, but has terrible grip. It lasted about 2 weeks without shoo goo.\r\n\r\nSavier Sherman: Good luck finding this one, but if you do, buy it. Lasted 4 weeks and then a few more of on and off skating with a hot glue gun for patchwork. Great grip, great seamless toe, aight padding, and good board feel. Definitely a top pick.\r\n\r\nI-Path Grasshopper: Great shoe, but lasts about 2 weeks at most with shoe goo. Great board feel, aight toe area, not too much cushioning, but overall my favorite shoe ever.\r\n\r\nI-Path Bangera: Great shoe, hard to find. Great toe area, great padding, great board feel, not too great durability, lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Overall a top pick, but not so easy to find.\r\n\r\nI-Path Yogi Hi: Not my favorite I-Path, but my friend had his and loved them. Not too great on padding, boardfeel, or cushioning, but aight durability. Lasted 3 weeks, and not a top pick.\r\n\r\nI-Path Cricket: Basically a low-top Grasshopper, but for some reason they didn''t last as long or have as good break in time. Not such a good pick overall.\r\n\r\nDvs Prophet: It''s aight. Good board feel, good cushioning, aight durability, overall a solid pick, but not good enough for a perfectionist.\r\n\r\nNike Dunk Mid: Not a SB, but I really liked having more board feel and less cushioning. It was a great shoe and even better in SB.\r\n\r\nAdidas Torrent: Built like a tank. With a little shoe goo, these could last you about 2 months or about seven weeks, a world record for me. The only setback is that some of the foam near the rubber toecap begins to wear, but overall, a little shoe goo will fix that. The board feel is superior, but it does not have a high break in time. Has great cushioning and a nice rubber toe cap. Overall a great shoe, styled like a DC Lynx 2, but less tech and longer lasting.\r\n\r\nDC Lynx 2: Overall its aight. I would recommend it to mostly ledge skateboarders, because it just didn''t have enough cushioning for my bruised up feet. Excellent grip and board feel. The super suede is ok, but you still need shoe goo. Overall it''s ok, but it only lasts 3 weeks before the grip on the bottom goes out and all you have is your sock poking through.\r\n\r\nEs Accel Plus: It''s ok, a lot of people say that accels are where its at, but after a week of skateboarding the sole still didn''t break in. They are overall allright shoes if you get them in leather, but they didn''t break in to my standards in three weeks, and by that time, the sole pretty mush wore out from skateboarding every single second of the day because it was Thanksgiving break. Overall, not too great in my opinion, but if you like them, you like them.\r\n\r\nSavier Cooper: Not my favorite Savier, but excellent durability, it just seemed like it skated weird, and the grip was weirdin out. Overall it''s ok, but not too great.\r\n\r\nEs K4: I got them when I was young and niave, but they looked like an all black basketball shoe and to say the least, skated like one. They had great boardfeel, but the whole rounded rubber toe cap thing threw me off and the grip wore out in like 4 weeks, which nowadays would last about one week, so don''t buy them.\r\n\r\nEtnies Sal 23: Excellent shoe, especially with shoe goo. Great grip, great durability, great and minimal padding, but no cushioning, but it doesn''t matter. Great shoe to just put on and skate. Right now, these shoes have lasted about a month and I intend to wear them until the sole goes out, so I''m guessing they will last about five weeks top. Also, don''t shy away from these shoes because other punks label them as "poser shoes", because they are definitely one of the greatest shoes created.\r\n\r\nOverall I''d go with the Sal 23 if you''re into Accels, because they''re like them, but without the bulk. But If you have the money to get new shoes often, or you don''t go thru shoes too fast, get Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nShoe Release Anticipated: Waiting on word about how those new Supras are gonna be and REALLY waiting for that new I-Path Locust. It looks like a Grasshopper with new grip so it will last longer, making it the best shoe ever.', 517, 1155, 0, '2006-01-21 18:30:00'),

(3320, 'Lakai Mariano -\r\n\r\nStyle: The look of this shoe is definitely a strong point. No matter which, of the few color ways you buy, you shall not be disappointed. It’s built with suede and leather, giving a classic and stylish look to it.\r\n\r\nComfort: When you first slip your foot in, whether it be trying it on or what not, you feel a lot of pressure at the arch in your foot. Needless to say, the arch is high in this shoe. But, after about one day or less of wearing the shoe, your arch molds to the arch, which is a great thing for your foot! After the “arch attack” goes away, this shoe could be one of the most comfortable shoes on the market today! The thin material the shoe is made of allows your foot to become one with the shoe.\r\n\r\nBoardfeel: The part of a shoe that most people are always looking for most is boardfeel. And the Mariano brings that to the table. The sole is very thin, and so is the sole pad, allowing for great board feel! However, basically the only downside of this shoe, the great boardfeel takes away a lot from the padding. Even after landing a five stair, I could feel the sting on the bottom of my foot. The shoe does have an EVA mid-sole, but it does not do as much good as it should.\r\n\r\nGrip: The grip was pretty average. I mean, it was good, but could have been better, especially around the toe area. The shoe uses the zig-zig pattern, in line with a circle pattern. I would have been much happier with the grip if it was all zigzags, because that held up well, and the circles did not. This all happened in about one month. Which is still pretty good.\r\n\r\nDurability: Although the shoe is thin, it has superb durability. After finally getting the shoe, I skated for about one and half to two hours, doing kickflips, heelflip, varial flips, varial heelflips, every trick I knew, not a scratch. After that I was quite happy with the shoe, and looked forward to wearing it. The toe cap was what I was impressed with the most, I skated constantly doing a variety of flip tricks every single day for about 3 months, still, the mariano was perfectly skate-able(with very minor rips. Then, after my 3rd month, it started to tear in the toe cap, and on the sole. The hidden lace protection system actually works! I didn’t have to change my laces the entire four months I had them!\r\n\r\nOverall: Overall the Lakai Mariano was a great shoe for me! Obviously, the results will differ from person to person, but there most likely will not be any drastic changes. The price was a hefty $75, but it was definitely worth it! So, if you’re looking for a very durable, thin, and stylish shoe, I would give my highest recommendations to the Mariano.', 517, 370, 0, '2007-01-06 18:30:00'),

(3356, 'Lakai Kost-one\r\n\r\nThe Lakai Kost-One is a pro model shoe designed by Eric Koston\r\n\r\nThe main features are:\r\nLeather upper with breathable mesh and perforations.\r\nForm fitting upper provides increased board feel.\r\nOptional hidden lacing system.\r\nFull length shock absorbing insole.\r\nHeel pulls for easy installation.\r\nStyle/Look: There are many different colorways for this shoe. There is at least one for everyone. This is a very flashy shoe, and can be worn with any color pants (if that means anything to you.)\r\n\r\nGrip: The grip is average. Underneath the toe, especially, it will wear down. With mine, it took about two months for the grip to wear down. Although I continued to skate them, it still somewhat, annoyed me.\r\n\r\nBoardfeel: Excellent boardfeel. Just enough that it doesn’t hurt when you step on small rocks, but enough that you can feel where the board’s concave is. Also, the boardfeel does not take away from the padding, so big falls will not be a problem.\r\n\r\nComfort: Honestly, this is quite odd for me to say this about a lakai shoe, but the comfort level isn’t very high. If I were to rate it, I’d say about a 6 out of 10. The reason for this mediocrity is that the shoe is very thin. In most lakai shoes, there is a great amount of padding along the side, and heel, of the shoe. In the Kost-ones, there isn’t much. But it isn’t all that bad. If you are into thin shoes, like I am, and you don’t care too much about comfort, this is the shoe for you!\r\n\r\nDurability: Great durability. This shoe has a very unique toe cap. First there is a layer of nubuck on top, which wears away quickly, but then, underneath it, is a somewhat plastic material which lasts a while. However, if you are a beginner, just learning kickflips, and you are constantly dragging your poor shoes along your rough grip tape, the toe cap may not last very long. The same also goes with heelflips. It has the same combination of nubuck and plastic. I had these since Christmas which is a little over 3 months. I’m not completely done with this shoe. I may, occasionally, skate it. But I have a good enough understanding of it to make a review. So with that said, The Lakai Kost-one should last you at least one and a half to two months.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall: This is a great shoe for any type of skater. With the cost being a somewhat pricey $74.99, it is still worth all the money. Koston’s first Lakai shoe is a definite success and I recommend it to everyone.', 517, 370, 0, '2007-04-04 18:30:00'),

(3434, 'There is really no use for this review thread because most of the people who review shoes report that their shoes lasted longer than a month. All skate shoe companies use 400 nbs rubber, which is very grippy, but wears down quickly depending on the shape of the tread: ie zig-zag, waffle, etc. Larger athletic shoe companies such as nike, adidas, and reebok use a harder and less grippy rubber that lasts longer. Soles on skate shoes should be completely burned out after 2-3 weeks of heavy skating. Soles on nikes and adidas''s can last 3-4 weeks tops. Uppers are generally similar and if the shoes are not vulcanized, they will rip usually after the first few days of skating them. Cushioning is generally the same in most skate shoes with eva inserts, but soletech, dc, supra, and adidas have gel and air inserts that are generally ineffective in protecting against heel bruises. Nike has rather effective cushioning in most of their skate shoes with dual density foam insoles that implement zoom air technology. Vulcanized shoes usually have better board feel and grip than non-vulcanized, but it depends on the sole thickness and the type of rubber. I have skated all brands of skate shoes and when it comes to buying shoes, its all about preference. Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who is not shop sponsored and who skates their shoes to the death, so if you skate harder than me, your shoes will wear out faster, and if you are still new to skateboarding your shoes will probably last a few months regardless of the brand.', 517, 1155, 0, '2007-12-09 18:30:00'),

No one is going to notice your shoes are fake, unless they are a real SB collector and stares at your shoes for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt''s not that fakes are just SBs not made by nike. The main reasons are.\r\n\r\n1. Your money isen''t going into skateboarding, it''s going into some guys pocket.\r\n\r\n2. The more fakes people buy, the more fakes people sell, and the level of fakes, grows and grows....\r\n\r\n3.

(5800, 'Quote:\r\nOriginally Posted by Taylor\nthe debate about girl''s pants on guys is very polarizing, it''s always split in two between supporters and haters.\r\nI haven''t seen anyone say "why can''t girls wear shoes that are meant for them", hell they even make women''s dunks.\r\n\r\nGirl''s shoes are designed that way for several reasons:\r\n1. Sizing\r\n2. Color\r\n3. Designed to look good with women''s clothing, i.e design of boots, heels, casual shoes being thinner to match slim clothing\r\n\r\nA girl with any sneaker, whether it be Dunk, AF1, whatever, will always be "just a friend" to me, and I know a few. They''re just too tomboyish and try too hard to fit in with the guys.\r\nGenerally women''s feet are shaped differently than men''s, but that does not mean that %100 of women are going to have the same size foot that is the same shape. I''m pretty sure that the idea that modern women are individuals who have their own sense of style and personality has not crossed your mind. Maybe a girl doesn''t like PINK AND PURPLE FRILLY SHOES, does that make her a hardcore dyke to you? Have you ever thought that maybe a men''s shoe might fit a certain girl better than a general women''s shoe; and possibly feel more comfortable to wear? I''ve only had 2 pairs of shoes made for girls. Just 2. Do you know why? Of course you dont. It''s because they SUCK. The quality of women''s shoes is horrible. Keep in mind I''m talking about skateboarding. Women Mark are too small for me and very uncomfortable. Plus, as far as I can recall they have only released 2 different Mark in womens and mens. The purps and the new tweed 2s. You''re probably the type who would call the Easter Tres "gay" because they have green and pink on them and are a men''s shoe. I''m not "trying to fit in with the guys" by wearing what I wear or doing what I do. I am myself and I do what I like. If that doesn''t suit your standards I don''t really give a ***** because as far as I am concerned you are just an ignorant twat. I''m not going to turn this into a women''s rights argument thread with you either.

(7138, 'Quote:\r\nOriginally Posted by Johnson\r\nNike SB is the only skateboard shoe company that makes super limited edition shoes.\r\nGR is equal to 20,000 pairs tops. Which is considerably low. Keeping the supply low keeps the price up. Everyone knows this. It''s a matter of being a good consumer.. A prosumer if you must. Find the right deals if you want them that bad. I could probably find a pair of shoes for $20 bucks that some other moron would pay $100 for. Nobody wants w/b PR1s anymore because PR2s are the new hype. Meaning prices go down on the PR1s... I don''t know if there are any on ebay right now, but I''m sure you could do BIN $60, if not LESS, on a pair if you just wait for the right deal to come around.\r\n\r\nMost people let the hype get to them... I admit I''ve done it too, but I once heard something about don''t pay more than $100 on shoes that you can''t or won''t wear in the rain. I''ve worn all my SBs in the rain and frankly I don''t give a shit. I''m lucky enough to have access to SBs at box price and below when they are released and sometimes even before.\r\n\r\nI can feel for the people who want to have their own opinion on SBs, but still have yet to get ahold of some. I''m buying skate shoes. I''m buying them to rip them apart. Personally, I get my $68 worth out of my PR2s and I got my $60 worth out of my Weigers and however much I''ve spent on any SB that I have.\r\n\r\nBottom line is... it''s about personal preference and just not being an idiot when it comes to buying your shoes. It''s kind of like the radio... If you don''t like the music change the station. If you don''t like the price or think the shoe sucks don''t buy them.

The trucks also feature the same 6/4 titanium axles as used on our TiAX trucks, come standard with Bones® Hardcore Bushings™ and share the same true-turn geometry of the rest of the Theeve range.\r\n\r\nTiAX - Theeve has created the world’s first 6/4 Titanium axle truck. TiAX Titanium axles are 40% lighter and 2 times stronger than standard steel axles. This gives you a weight saving and less chance of bending axles.

I locker the kingpin nut a lot.. so the kingpin top is really lower than the top of the kingpin nut -but I still don''t grind on the kingpin nut. I took 30 min - hard turns in bowl/ pool to get the pivot cups comfortable...\r\n\r\nAh btw, what I notice was.. that I had really hard to stick the pivots in their place and hat to push (a little bit) the hanger into the pivot cup (so the kingpin ins centered in the hanger-hole.\r\n\r\nAfter the first rides the Theeve felt damn comfortable... they ain''t that turny like Thunder with bones hc bushings BUT they are really stable and you can do every trick very clean... I think (maybe it was just luck) with ''em I got the best run today - cause I focus on grind tricks (metal-coping) and Theeve are really really comfortable and fast about grinds.\r\n\r\nAfter an 5h session - I take a look at the bushings (don''t use a bottom washer - just top)... and they seems to be (1st look) fine... I could recordnize that they starts to deform yet... It seems that if you loose your kingpin nut a lot more - than they bushings won''t be stressed to much...\r\n\r\nBut this is just my first Impression... I found my perfect setting @ kingpin nut and don''t want to loose the nut again to see what''s up with the bushings...\r\n\r\nAh yeah.. also I noticed that I didn''t get any wheelburns.. no marks on my brand new creature deck... back in the days I got notice able burn marks with the Theeve TiaX V2 on my deck with 58mm wheels and 1/4" riser pad... now (with khiro pivot) I use the same riser pad size but use 60mm wheels and no burns...\r\n\r\nWe''ll see what happens to the bushings if I took more sessions with them...', 549, 815, 0, '2012-08-10 18:30:00'),

If you are an all-around rider: As discussed in the durometer section, all-around skaters will need to find a middle ground when it comes to wheel size. Select some mid-sized wheels –somewhere between 52-60mm –and you’ll find that you can tackle most terrain comfortably. If you cruise/longboard: Longboarders and other riders who like to carve out sections of road on big, fat boards tend to require larger wheels to give them speed and stability. Longboard-specific wheels are generally about 64-75mm in diameter, but there are even larger wheels out there if you so desire. Bottom line, the larger the wheels, the faster you go; the smaller the wheels, the closer to the ground you’ll ride and the lighter your board will be. It should also be noted that smaller people tend to do better riding on smaller wheels, while larger people might feel more comfortable on bigger wheels. This is all a matter of riding style and personal preference, so use these ranges as a starting-off point and determine the best fit for your own set-up.', 588, 279, 0, '2013-11-30 18:30:00'),
